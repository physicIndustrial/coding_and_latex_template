\section{Lily's Window}

cLily was a little girl who had been sick for a very long time. Her world was small, mostly confined to her room and the view from her window. Outside, the great Whispering Woods stretched out, a place of endless green and secrets. Lily longed to play in the woods, to feel the moss under her feet and the sun on her face.

One day, as she was watching the birds from her bed, a tiny, glowing creature fluttered up to her window. It had wings like a dragonfly and a soft, warm light. It introduced itself as a Lumina, a forest spirit. The Lumina, seeing Lily's sadness, decided to bring the woods to her.

Every day, the Lumina would visit, telling her stories of the forest. It described the chatter of the squirrels, the wisdom of the old oak tree, and the secret language of the fireflies. Lily's room, once a place of quiet sickness, was now filled with the magic of the Whispering Woods. Though she was still inside, her heart was out there, dancing with the spirits of the forest.
